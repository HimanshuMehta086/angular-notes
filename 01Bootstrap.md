# Topic 1: Bootstrapping

1. Angular processes the `main.ts`
2. If the `environment` is set for `production`, the production specific settings are applied as defined in the `angular.json`
3. Angular abstraction over the browser DOM is applied by `platformBrowserDynamic()`. This lets angular process the templates defined by the components.
4. This `platformBrowserDynamic()` returns `PlatformRef`, called as the Angular platform.
5. On this `PlatformRef` we call `bootstrapModule()` passing the root module called `AppModule`.
6. Angular then goes on to process the `AppModule`. It does so by reading the `@NgModule` decorator. Inside the `@NgModule` decorator, there is a configuration object (JSON). We can safely assume that Angular is all about **declarables** (components, directives, pipes), **importables** (modules: built-in, third-party, and feature modules), **injectables** (such as services are declared in providers upto Angular 6). Now we use a diffrent approach for injectables. In the `bootstrap`, one of the components declared earlier is listed. _Though it is possible to bootstrap multiple components, it is recommended to use a single component as the root component unless there is a specific need._
7. Angular now processes the bootstrapping component. `@Component` metadata is read. Every component has 4 parts: component class (**.ts**), template (**.html**), style (**.css**), and test (**.spec.ts**). Most important of these files is the **_component class_** file. This has `@Component` applied to it. The template and style are marked in the metadata as `templateUrl` and `styleUrls`. _Only one template per component is allowed_ while _it is possible to have multiple style files (styleUrls is an array)_. Note here that, in the `@Component` metadata we can also output the raw html using `template` property. _This is not recommeded for serious application development_. If we want to use this for whatever reason, we should note that _we cannot use both `tempalteUrl` and `template` at the same time_. In the `@Component` metadata, we have `selector` property. This is the custom selector which will be used in the html to denote this component. The idea is, whenever we want the template to be displayed (output) in the html, we do so by using this selector such as `<app-compx></app-compx>`. **_It's not recommended to change the selector name lest it clash with native html selectors_**. As HTML is an evolving standard, using general terms (such as navbar, sidebar, content, page, footer, etc) for out component selectors might cause conflict if not now, perhaps later. **Angular recommends all component selectors be prefixed with `app-`**. We follow this convention throughout.
8. Then Angular processes the index.html file. We have `<app-root></app-root>` element, which the browser doesn't understand (it's not a standard HTML selector). Angular outputs the respective component's template here. If we are bootstrapping a component, Angular expects that selector to be present in the index.html (otherwise it's an error).
